This app, built as part of an undergraduate course, allows users to schedule appointments between company contacts and their customers. The application adjusts for the
user's local time (using Java's LocalDateTime class) and validates appointments to prevent overlapping appointments and appointments outside of business
hours (ET). This application utilizes JavaFX for the GUI, Java for the application programming, and MySQL for the
database. Thanks for stopping by!
